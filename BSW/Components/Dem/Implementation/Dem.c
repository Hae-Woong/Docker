/* module specific MISRA deviations:

   MD_DEM_1.1_612
     Description: Rule 1.1
                  All code shall conform to ISO 9899:1990 C programming language, ISO 9899, amended and corrected by
                  ISO/IEC 9899/COR1:1995, ISO/IEC 9899/AMD1:1995, and ISO/IEC 9899/COR2: 1996
     Reason:      Depending on the configuration size the generated tables can
                  exceed the C90 limit of 32767 bytes
     Risk:        Compilation error.
     Prevention:  Compiler compatibility must be tested during integration.

   MD_DEM_613
     Description: Rule ISO:C99-5.2.4.1 Translation Limits
                  [L] Size of object '%1s' exceeds 65535 bytes - program does not conform strictly to ISO:C99.
     Reason:      Depending on the configuration size the generated tables can
                  exceed the C99 limit of 65535 bytes
     Risk:        Compilation error.
     Prevention:  Compiler compatibility must be tested during integration.

   MD_DEM_Dir1.1
     Description: MISRA2012-Dir1.1
                  Any implementation-defined behaviour on which the output of the program 
                  depends shall be documented and understood.
     Reason:      QAC itself states: A 'pointer-to-object' can always be converted safely to a 'pointer-to-void'.
     Risk:        None.
     Prevention:  Only used in context of null pointer checks.

   MD_DEM_Dir1.1_EventEntryPtrTableAccess
     Description: MISRA2012-Dir1.1
                  Apparent: Implicit conversion to a signed integer type of insufficient size.
     Reason:      This is a False Positive.
                  An uint32 index is used to access Dem_EventEntryPtr[]. No implicit conversion to a signed integer
                  happens in this case.
     Risk:        Reading data of wrong event entry due to overflow of the index during conversion to smaller type.
     Prevention:  Correct access is verified during code review.

   MD_DEM_8.6:
     Description: Rule 8.6
                  An identifier with external linkage shall have exactly one external definition.
     Reason:      To increase the speed of the building process, the Dem is built exclusively in header files.
                  Functions are defined in the respective "_Implementation.h" files of the units. Functions may only
                  be defined within the implementation file of the respective unit in which they were declared.
                  Functions may only be declared and defined once. Implementation files are treated like C files
                  and therefore must not be included by anyone except the DemS.c file.
     Risk:        None.
     Prevention:  None.

   MD_DEM_8.7:
     Description: Rule 8.7
                  Objects shall be defined at block scope if they are only accessed from within a single function.
     Reason:      Vector style guide prevents usage of static variables in function scope
     Risk:        None.
     Prevention:  None.

   MD_DEM_8.5_declarationInMultipleFiles:
     Description: Rule 8.5
                  The global identifier '%s' has been declared in more than one file.
     Reason:      Some MICROSAR modules generate prototypes of Dem APIs. This leads to duplicate declarations in separate files.
                  For example: SchM declares Dem_<X>MainFunction(), Rte declares SWC APIs of Dem such as Dem_SetEventAvailable().
     Risk:        None.
     Prevention:  None.

   MD_DEM_8.5_multipleDeclarations:
     Description: Rule 8.5
                  Multiple declarations of external object or function.
     Reason:      Some MICROSAR modules generate prototypes of Dem APIs. This leads to duplicate declarations.
                  For example SchM declares Dem_<X>MainFunction().
                  For example: SchM declares Dem_<X>MainFunction(), Rte declares SWC APIs of Dem such as Dem_SetEventAvailable().
     Risk:        None.
     Prevention:  None.

   MD_DEM_8.5_rte:
     Description: Rule 8.5
                  An external object or function shall be declared in one and only one file.
     Reason:      MICROSAR Rte generates prototypes for callbacks. Some callbacks are also contained in a replacement
                  header in case no Rte is used. This leads to duplicate declarations.
     Risk:        None.
     Prevention:  None.

   MD_DEM_Rule10.5_Enum
     Description: MISRA2012-Rule10.5
                  The value of an expression should not be cast to an inappropriate essential type
     Reason:      The cast is required for conversion of integer value. Integer value required for bitwise operation.
                  Using essential type instead of enum gives no advantage. Enum range is far smaller than provided by essential base type.
     Risk:        Data corruption due to miscast.
     Prevention:  Covered by descriptive enum type definition and code review of the correct usage.

   MD_DEM_10.8_DTRFloatToInteger:
     Description:  Rule10.8
                   A composite expression of 'essentially floating' type is being cast to a different type category.
     Reason:       The cast is required, since DTR values shall be calculated with floating point precision, but are 
                   reported in form of integer values.
     Risk:         Data corruption due to miscast.
     Prevention:    None.

   MD_DEM_10.8_TdFloatToInteger:
     Description:  Rule10.8
                   A composite expression of 'essentially floating' type is being cast to a different type category.
     Reason:       Time since last sample collection (Td) must be calculated with floating point precision,
                   since the DEM Main function task time allows using values with floating point precision.
                   The cast is required, since the Td must be reported in form of a 16 bit
                   integer value as per OEM requirement.
                   The maximum possible value of Td is less than the sampling rate (which is limited to 0xFFFF). This
                   ensures that the Td can fit inside the 16 bit integer value.
                   However, if a floating point DEM Main function task time is used, then data could be lost on
                   conversion.
     Risk:         Data corruption due to miscast.
     Prevention:   None.

   MD_DEM_10.8_TdIntermediateIntegerToFloat:
     Description:  Rule10.8
                   The value of a composite expression shall not be cast to a different essential type category or a wider essential type
     Reason:       Time since last sample collection (Td) must be calculated with floating point precision,
                   since the DEM Main function task time allows using values with floating point precision.
                   The intermediate must be cast to float32 before multiplying with the Dem Main function
                   cycle time since it itself is a floating point value.
     Risk:         Data corruption due to miscast.
     Prevention:   None.

   MD_DEM_11.1:
     Description:  Rule 11.1
                  Conversions shall not be performed between a pointer to a function and any type other than an integral type.
     Reason:      Different types of callback functions need to be supported through a generic mechanism
     Risk:        Functions are cast to the wrong type before calling.
     Prevention:  The correct function type is indicated by type tagging. The correct cast is verified during code review.

   MD_DEM_11.4_cpy:
     Description: Rule 11.4
                  A cast should not be performed between a pointer to object type and a different pointer to object
                  type.
     Reason:      Use of memcopy/memset requires common pointer type.
     Risk:        Data corruption due to miscast.
     Prevention:  Covered by descriptive pointer types and code review for correct usage.

   MD_DEM_11.4_inh:
     Description: Rule 11.4
                  A cast should not be performed between a pointer to object type and a different pointer to object
                  type.
     Reason:      Use of inheritance pattern requires cast to specific class type.
     Risk:        Data corruption due to miscast.
     Prevention:  Covered by descriptive pointer types and code review for correct usage.

   MD_DEM_11.4_nvm:
     Description: Rule 11.4
                  A cast should not be performed between a pointer to object type and a different pointer to object
                  type.
     Reason:      Mechanism for Nv handling requires common pointer type
     Risk:        None. Pointers are initially aligned and only cast due to common API later on.
     Prevention:  Covered by descriptive pointer types and code review for correct usage.

   MD_DEM_11.4_sr:
     Description: Rule 11.4
                  A cast should not be performed between a pointer to object type and a different pointer to object
                  type.
     Reason:      Serialization of typed data.
     Risk:        Data corruption due to miscast.
     Prevention:  Covered by descriptive pointer types and code review for correct usage.

   MD_DEM_11.8:
     Description: Rule 11.8
                  A cast shall not be performed that removes any const or volatile qualification from the type
                  addressed by a pointer.
     Reason:      MemSet and MemCpy are defined as taking an unqualified pointer.
     Risk:        None.
     Prevention:  Safe access of shared data is verified during code review.

   MD_DEM_13.5_cf:
     Description: Rule 13.5
                  The right hand operand of a logical && or || operator shall not contain persistent side effects
     Reason:      The function called on the right hand side has no persistent side effects.
     Risk:        The function may introduce side effects at a later time.
     Prevention:  Code analysis (e.g. MISRA).

   MD_DEM_13.5_volatile:
     Description: Rule 13.5
                  The right hand operand of a logical && or || operator shall not contain persistent side effects
     Reason:      The function's side effect is restricted to readout of 'volatile' RAM value (causing changed hardware registers)
                  Dem's functionality does not rely on register states.
     Risk:        The function may introduce side effects at a later time.
     Prevention:  Code analysis (e.g. MISRA).

   MD_DEM_13.2_Order_Read_Accesses_Volatile
     Description: Rule 13.2
                  The value of an expression and its persistent side-effects shall be the same under all permitted
                  evaluation orders
     Reason:      The order of read accesses to the volatile variables is not significant.
     Risk:        None.
     Prevention:  None.

   MD_DEM_13.3:
     Description: Rule 13.3
                  Floating-point expressions shall not be tested for equality or inequality.
     Reason:      Test for generated special value.
     Risk:        None
     Prevention:  Correctness is ensured in test suite.

   MD_DEM_14.1_ACCESSOR
     Description: Rule 14.1
                  Static function '%s()' is not used within this translation unit.
     Reason:      Accessor function ('getter', 'setter') is present although no code is actively using it.
                  Accessor functions do not provide functionality, and are not conditionally compiled to increase
                  maintainability.
     Risk:        Compiler warnings depending on configuration.
                  No reduced code size with a special configuration, not realized optimization.
     Prevention:  None.

   MD_DEM_14.1_LIB
     Description: Rule 14.1
                  Static function '%s()' is not used within this translation unit.
     Reason:      Function is present although no code is actively using it. Function is used as library function
                  and is therefore always available.
     Risk:        Compiler warnings depending on configuration.
                  No reduced code size with a special configuration, not realized optimization.
     Prevention:  None.

   MD_DEM_2.1_UNREACHABLE_STATEMENT:
     Description: Rule 2.1
                  This code is unreachable.
     Reason:      In specific configurations, the comparison evaluates to a constant expression.
                  When an 'if' condition works on the constant expression which always evaluates
                  to true, the code within the 'else' part cannot be reached, and vice versa.
     Risk:        Compiler warnings or compiler errors depending on configuration.
                  Unreachable code cannot be tested in specific configurations.
     Prevention:  None.

   MD_DEM_14.1_CONFIGURATION_SWITCH:
     Description: Rule 14.1
                  This function is unreachable
     Reason:      In specific configurations, preprocessor configuration switches encapsulate all function calls.
                  Which means, that the corresponding function is never called in specific configurations and can be
                  omitted within the compile process.
                  This justification shall only be used, until all configuration dependent preprocessor switches are removed.
     Risk:        Compiler warnings or compiler errors depending on configuration.
                  Unreachable code cannot be tested in specific configurations.
     Prevention:  None.

   MD_DEM_14.2:
     Description: Rule 14.2
                  All non-null statements shall either (i) have at least one side-effect however executed, or
                  (ii) cause control flow to change
     Reason:      This statement is used to avoid warnings caused by unused parameters. Parameters are defined by
                  standardized API requirements, and not needed in case a feature is disabled by configuration.
                  It is either impossible due to API standardization or necessary code duplication (severe maintenance
                  increase) to provide feature dependent APIs with different signatures.
     Risk:        Unavoidable compiler warning or error because of either unused statements or unused parameter.
     Prevention:  None.

   MD_DEM_14.2_CONFIGURATION_SWITCH:
     Description: Rule 14.2
                  All non-null statements shall either (i) have at least one side-effect however executed, or
                  (ii) cause control flow to change
     Reason:      This statement is used to avoid warnings caused by unused parameters. Parameters are defined by
                  standardized API requirements, and not needed in case a feature is disabled by configuration.
                  It is either impossible due to API standardization or necessary code duplication (severe maintenance
                  increase) to provide feature dependent APIs with different signatures.
                  This justification shall only be used, until all configuration dependent preprocessor switches are removed.
     Risk:        Unavoidable compiler warning or error because of either unused statements or unused parameter.
     Prevention:  None.

  MD_DEM_14.2_LoopControl
    Description: Rule 14.2
                 Loop control variable in this 'for' statement, %s, is not modified inside loop.
                 No variable appears to be incremented in the third expression of this 'for' statement (control variable
                 identified as %1s).
    Reason:      As long as Dem is not in a consistent state, the loop control variable is always modified inside the loop.
                 If Dem is in an inconsistent state the loop is terminated immediately.
    Risk:        Loop could execute indefinitely.
    Prevention:  Verified by review that loop will be terminated, if Dem is in an inconsistent state.

   MD_DEM_15.4_opt:
     Description: Rule 15.4
                  More than one 'break' statement has been used to terminate this iteration statement.
     Reason:      Increased efficiency on the time critical path.
     Risk:        Maintainability is adversely affected.
     Prevention:  The break statement is documented.

   MD_DEM_15.5:
     Description: Rule 15.5
                  A function should have a single point of exit at the end.
     Reason:      Due to maintainability problems the control flow through the function shall not be complicated even
                  further.
     Risk:        Maintainability is adversely affected.
     Prevention:  None.

   MD_DEM_15.2:
     Description: Rule 15.2
                  An unconditional break statement shall terminate every non-empty switch clause.
     Reason:      The fall-through is preferred to an if-else cascade to avoid code duplication in this particular
                  circumstance.
     Risk:        Adverse effect on maintainability.
     Prevention:  The fall-through is documented.

   MD_DEM_16.3_Continue:
     Description: Rule 16.3
                  Final 'switch' clause ends with a 'jump' statement other than 'break'.
     Reason:      The continue statement is used in a circumstance where a different approach would reduce efficiency
                  or maintainability due to increased complexity.
     Risk:        None.
     Prevention:  None.

   MD_DEM_8.3_dcm:
     Description: Rule 8.3
                  All declarations of an object or function shall use the same names and type qualifiers.
     Reason:      Dcm generates its own prototypes based on a generic algorithm.
     Risk:        Dcm prototypes can deviate from the implementation.
     Prevention:  Verify compatibility during integration tests.

   MD_DEM_8.3_rte:
     Description: Rule 8.3
                  All declarations of an object or function shall use the same names and type qualifiers.
     Reason:      Port-Defined arguments are not generated with the correct name. This can currently not be influenced
                  due to the RTE being a third party module.
     Risk:        None. The generated prototypes are never used directly but only from generated RTE code.
     Prevention:  None.

   MD_DEM_8.13:
     Description: Rule 8.13
                  A pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible.
     Reason:      The API is standardized and a change would break compliance.
     Risk:        None.
     Prevention:  None.

   MD_DEM_8.13_fp:
     Description: Rule 8.13
                  A pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible.
     Reason:      The data behind the pointer is modified, or modified in some configurations. This is a false positive.
     Risk:        None.
     Prevention:  None.

   MD_DEM_8.13_Internal:
     Description: Rule 8.13
                  A pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible.
     Reason:      The API has to be compatible to a common prototype
     Risk:        None.
     Prevention:  None.

   MD_DEM_8.13_Design:
     Description: Rule 8.13
                  A pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible.
     Reason:      The function has write access to shared state. The caller may not rely on constancy. Even if the
                  current implementation does not need write access, this is allowed to change. A stable interface is
                  preferred to adhering to this rule.
     Risk:        None.
     Prevention:  None.

   MD_DEM_16.9_fp:
     Description: Rule 16.9
                  A function identifier shall only be used with either a preceding &, or with a parenthesised parameter
                  list, which may be empty.
     Reason:      There is a preceeding &, and the use as a function pointer is intended
     Risk:        None.
     Prevention:  None.

   MD_DEM_19.13:
     Description: Rule 19.13
                  K&R compilers do not support the ISO glue operator '##'.
     Reason:      This kind of implementation creates the least MISRA warnings.
     Risk:        K&R compilers will not work.
     Prevention:  Integration test using target compiler, error directives to detect evaluation errors.

   MD_DEM_20.2:
     Description: Rule 20.2
                  The names of standard library macros, objects and functions shall not be reused.
     Reason:      Included from vector standard library.
     Risk:        Name collision with different standard library.
     Prevention:  None.

   MD_DEM_14.2_LoopControlHandledInternally:
     Description: Rule 14.2
                  The variable identified as the control variable in this 'for' loop has been modified inside the body of the loop.
     Reason:      Incrementation of the control variable inside the loop is necessary to realize certain functionality or better readability.
     Risk:        Increased complexity of the code.
     Prevention:  Correctness of code verified by code review and testcases.

   MD_DEM_14.2_FalsePositive:
     Description: Rule 14.2
     The variable identified as the control variable in this 'for' loop has been modified inside the body of the loop.
     Reason:      False positive, a structure containing the loop control variable is modified but not the loop control variable.
     Risk:        Increased complexity of the code.
     Prevention:  Correctness of code verified by code review and testcases.

   MD_DEM_14.2_LoopInitialisation:
     Description: Rule 14.2
                  No variable appears to be initialized in the first expression of this 'for loop'.
     Reason:      False positive, in the first expression of the for loop the loop control variable is passed as an argument to a
                  function which initializes it.
     Risk:        None.
     Prevention:  None.

  MD_DEM_18.1_ComputingOfInvalidPointer_ReadoutBuffer:
    Description: Rule 18.1
                 Apparent: Computing an invalid pointer value.
    Reason:      This is a False positive. 
    Risk:        Read operation outside of the Dem memory region.
    Prevention:  Verified by review that only read operations are performed with the pointer.
                 Verified by review and testing that the ReadoutBufferId, which is used as an Index to the array
                 is always valid.

  MD_DEM_18.1_ComputingOfInvalidPointer:
    Description: Rule 18.1
                 Apparent: Computing an invalid pointer value.
    Reason:      This is a False positive.
    Risk:        Read and write operations outside the Dem memory region.
    Prevention:  Verified by a runtime check that the index used to access the member of an array
                 is always in a valid range. Thus the pointer pointing to this member is also always
                 valid.

   MD_DEM_2983:
     Description: Rule 2.2
                  This assignment is redundant. The value of this object is never subsequently used.
     Reason:      The function argument cannot be removed, because it is either used in a different configuration,
                  or required by design.
     Risk:        None.
     Prevention:  None.

   MD_DEM_2987:
    Description: Rule 2.2
                 This function call produces no side effects and is redundant.
    Reason:      In specific configurations, the function contains no code.
    Risk:        None.
    Prevention:  None.

   MD_DEM_3203:
     Description: Rule N/A
                  The variable '%s' is set but never used.
     Reason:      The variable cannot be removed, because it is used in a different configuration.
     Risk:        None.
     Prevention:  None.

   MD_DEM_3206:
     Description: Rule N/A
                  The parameter '%s' is not used in this function.
     Reason:      API / Standardized API is not adapted based on configuration
     Risk:        None.
     Prevention:  None.

   MD_DEM_3305:
     Description: Rule N/A
                  Pointer cast to stricter alignment
     Reason:      Already aligned pointers are handled in a generic way.
     Risk:        None.
     Prevention:  None.

   MD_DEM_Dir4.1_RunTimeCheckWriteOperation
     Description: Rule Dir4.1
                  Definite/Apparent/Suspicious: Dereference of an invalid pointer value.
     Reason:      This is a False Positive. The access is protected by runtime checks, which assert the array bounds.
     Risk:        Write access outside the bounds of an array, if runtime checks is disabled.
     Prevention:  Runtime checks prevent access, if enabled.

   MD_DEM_Dir4.1_ArrayWriteOperation
     Description: Rule Dir4.1
                  Definite/Apparent/Suspicious: Dereference of an invalid pointer value.
     Reason:      This is a False Positive. The index used to access the array is always valid.
     Risk:        Write access outside the bounds of an array.
     Prevention:  Verified by review that the index used to access the array is always valid.

   MD_DEM_Dir4.1_DereferencedPointerWriteOperation
     Description: Rule Dir4.1
                  Definite/Apparent/Suspicious: Dereference of an invalid pointer value.
     Reason:      This is a False Positive. The pointer passed to the function is always valid.
     Risk:        Write access outside the Dem memory region.
     Prevention:  Verified by review that the pointer passed to the function is always valid.

   MD_DEM_Dir4.1_EventEntryPointerAccess
     Description: Rule Dir4.1
     Definite/Apparent/Suspicious: Dereference of an invalid pointer value.
     Reason:      This is a False Positive. 
                  The runtime check and Safety Manual item referenced in 
                  SBSW_DEM_POINTER_WRITE_EVENTENTRY ensures that the accesses are always within bounds.
     Risk:        Read/ Write access outside the bounds of an array.
     Prevention:  Runtime checks and Safety Manual item prevent write access, if enabled.

   MD_DEM_Dir4.1_SatelliteInfoStructPointers
     Description: Rule Dir4.1
                  Apparent/Suspicious: Dereference of an invalid pointer value.
     Reason:      This is a False Positive. 
     Risk:        The DEM reads from an invalid memory location.
     Prevention:  The validity of macros pointing to the contents of SatelliteInfo structure is ensured through the 
                  Safety Manual Items CM_DEM_S_SIZEOF_SATELLITEINFOTYPE_ARRAYS, CM_DEM_S_SIZEOF_SATELLITEINFOTYPE_POINTER.
                  As per the SMIs, if the pointers are invalid, they must be defined as NULL_PTR. 
                  In case of an invalid configuration, the implementation reads a behind an invalid pointer, which is harmless.
                  The implementation verifies for NULL_PTR, a valid Satellite Id and Monitor Id before any write operation.

  MD_DEM_Dir4.1_NullPointerDereference
     Description: Rule Dir4.1
                  Definite/Apparent/Suspicious: Arithmetic operation on NULL pointer.
     Reason:      It appears that a Null pointer is dereferenced in some configurations.
                  This is only true if a limited scope is evaluated by a limited tool. In fact the scope is never active 
                  in this configuration.
     Risk:        Read access to memory that does not belong to Dem.
     Prevention:  Verified by review, that the read access is valid if done.

  MD_DEM_Dir4.1_ReadOperation
     Description: Rule Dir4.1
                  Definite/Apparent/Suspicious: Dereference of an invalid pointer value.
                  Definite/Apparent/Suspicious: Arithmetic operation on NULL pointer.
     Reason:      This is a False Positive.
     Risk:        Reading values at an invalid memory address.
                  Undefined behavior, due to incorrect read value.
     Prevention:  Verified by review, that the read accesses are valid.

  MD_DEM_Dir4.1_NullFunctionPointerCheck
     Description: Rule Dir4.1
                  Apparent: Dereference of NULL pointer.
     Reason:      This is a False Positive.
                  Before function pointer is dereferenced it is checked for NULL pointer.
     Risk:        None
     Prevention:  None


  MD_DEM_Dir4.1_ReadOperationLoopExit
     Description: Rule Dir4.1
                  Definite: Dereference of an invalid pointer value.
     Reason:      This is a false positive. The read operation is called in a loop. The loop exit condition
                  prevents the confirmed chronology index from being outside the bounds of the array.
     Risk:        Read Access outside the bounds of an array.
     Prevention:  Correct loop exit condition is verified during code review.

  MD_DEM_2982
     Description: Rule 2.2
                  This assignment is redundant. The value of this object is never used before being modified.
     Reason:      In specific configurations, the variable might not be used.
     Risk:        None.
     Prevention:  None.
  
  MD_DEM_2985:
    Description: Rule 2.2
                 This operation is redundant. The value of the result is always that of the left-hand operand.
    Reason:      In specific configurations, the right-hand operand can affect the value.
    Risk:        None.
    Prevention:  None.

  MD_DEM_2986:
    Description: Rule 2.2
                 This operation is redundant. The value of the result is always that of the right-hand operand.
    Reason:      In specific configurations, the left-hand operand can affect the value.
    Risk:        None.
    Prevention:  None.
  
  MD_DEM_2897:
    Description: Rule 2.2
                 Apparent: Negative value cast to an unsigned type.
    Reason:      Signed data values are stored in unsigned buffer or variable.
                 Nevertheless, no data loss occurs since casting to unsign do not change the bit values. Re-interpreting the 
                 buffer/variable content as signed values at a later point in time, gives original signed values.
    Risk:        Data corruption due to miscast.
    Prevention:  None.

   MD_DEM_2994:
     Description: Rule 14.3
                  The value of this 'while' or 'for' loop controlling expression is always 'false'. The loop will not be entered.
     Reason:      In specific configurations, the expression is true and the loop will be entered.
     Risk:        None.
     Prevention:  None.

   MD_DEM_2995:
     Description: Rule 2.2
                  The result of this logical operation is always 'true'.
     Reason:      In specific configurations, the comparison evaluates a constant expression
     Risk:        None.
     Prevention:  None.

   MD_DEM_2996:
     Description: Rule 2.2
                  The result of this logical operation is always 'false'.
     Reason:      In specific configurations, the comparison evaluates a constant expression
     Risk:        None.
     Prevention:  None.

   MD_DEM_2990:
     Description: Rule 14.3
                  The value of this 'if' controlling expression is always 'true'.
     Reason:      In specific configurations, the comparison evaluates a constant expression
     Risk:        None.
     Prevention:  None.

   MD_DEM_2991:
     Description: Rule 14.3
                  The value of this 'if' controlling expression is always 'true'.
     Reason:      In specific configurations, the comparison evaluates a constant expression
     Risk:        None.
     Prevention:  None.

   MD_DEM_2992:
     Description: Rule 14.3
                  The value of this 'if' controlling expression is always 'false'.
     Reason:      In specific configurations, the comparison evaluates a constant expression
     Risk:        None.
     Prevention:  None.

   MD_DEM_2993:
     Description: Rule 14.3
                  The value of this 'do - while' loop controlling expression is always 'false'.
                  The loop will only be executed once. 
     Reason:      In specific configurations, the comparison evaluates a constant expression
     Risk:        None.
     Prevention:  None.

   MD_DEM_6050_CONFIGURATION:
     Description: Metrics
                  Number of distinct function calls defined by HIS shall be in range 0..7
     Reason:      Depending on the configuration a different function is called to access similar configuration data.
     Risk:        Stack usage and runtime too high for target uC. Understandability and testability might become too complex.
     Prevention:  Use of inline functions and code review.

    \REASON This section only contains commentaries that are removed from the source before delivery.

  \ID COV_DEM_TESTCODE
    \REASON This section only contains code to help test the software. It has no influence on the actual code. All such
            code is removed from the source before delivery.

  \ID COV_DEM_RTE_TYPEDEFS
    \REASON Those preprocessor defines are a protection against double defines.

  \ID COV_DEM_UNSUPPORTED_FEATURE
    \REASON This feature is (currently) not supported. Activating the feature is prohibited by an #error directive.

  \ID COV_DEM_FAILED_RUNTIME_CHECKS
    \REASON This preprocessor switch can be enabled by a user configuration file in order to prevent un-initialization of
            the DEM in case of a failed run-time check. Using user configuration files is not allowed in silent configuration.

  \ID COV_DEM_USER_MACROS
    \REASON The condition checks whether a macro is defined and conditionally assigns a default implementation.
            When using an own macro implementation, the customer is responsible to ensure its safety.

  \ID COV_DEM_PREPROCESSOR_DEFINE
    \REASON The condition checks whether a preprocessor macro is defined and conditionally assigns a default value.

  \ID COV_DEM_UNSUPPORTED_TESTED_FEATURE
    \REASON The use of these features (preprocessor combinations) is for the customer prohibited by an #error directive.
            Nevertheless, as testing the features during component development shall be possible, compilation errors have to be
            suppressed during component tests.

  \ID COV_DEM_UNSUPPORTED_FEATURE_COMBINATION
    \REASON The use of this feature combination is (currently) not supported. The encapsulated code indicates that the function has
            to be reworked if this changes in the future.

  \ID COV_DEM_GENERATED_EVENTID
    \ACCEPT TF tf xf tf
    \REASON Verified by inspection: EventIds are generated that way that the first event Id is always assigned to primary memory.

  \ID COV_DEM_UNSUPPORTED_COMBINATION_GLOBAL_SRECS
    \ACCEPT TF tf xf tx
    \REASON For feature Global Snapshot Records, handling of all storage triggers and update status is implemented
            but not tested. Currently, the update status is limited to 'FALSE' and storage trigger is limited
            to 'Confirmed' through configuration.

  \ID COV_DEM_UNIT_ENTRY_CONFIGURATION_CHECK

    \ACCEPT XX
    \REASON Configuration checks on the interface of a unit, ensure that no actions can be performed by the disabled unit.
            The checks are performed on the entry of the unit, so that a compiler can optimize the underlying functionality out.
            Preprocessor switches are not used, since they would restrict the unit and multi-unit testability of the unit. 

  \ID COV_DEM_MISRA_BRANCH
    \ACCEPT TX
    \ACCEPT XX
    \REASON An empty branch is used here to fulfill MISRA Rule. The code is not reachable during normal execution. 
            MSR standard justification COV_MSR_MISRA is valid here.

  \ID COV_DEM_GETINDICATORSTATE_ROBUSTNESS
    \ACCEPT TF tx tf
    \REASON In the current implementation of the function, the check for lIndicatorState == DEM_INDICATOR_CONTINUOUS is
            unnecessary as it is always true due to the surrounding conditions. The check was kept in code nonetheless for a better
            understanding of the function and robustness.

  \ID COV_DEM_ROBUSTNESS
    \REASON In the current implementation, the check is superfluous when the Dem is behaving correctly (e.g. checks
            are already performed by the calling function or elsewhere). The branch coverage will later be increased through unit tests.
            However, for reasons of robustness, the check is retained in code.

                  receive a pointer to an iterator variable Dem_<X>IterType.
                  Dem_<X>IterInit or Dem_<X>IterResume initializes the iterator variable, so it is valid to be used
                  by the other functions. Those functions expect a reference to a valid iterator variable.
                  The iterator variable is still valid when those functions return.
  \COUNTERMEASURE \N The iterator variable is initialized using the appropriate Init function before passing its reference

                  The Dem_Cfg_<X>IterInit initializes the iterator variable, so it is valid to be used by the other three
                  functions. Those functions expect a reference to a valid iterator variable. The iterator variable is still
                  valid when those functions return.

                  Dem_Debounce<DEBOUNCING_ALGORITHM>_InfoInit are invoked with a pointer to the debouncing algorithm specific
                  Dem_Debounce<DEBOUNCING_ALGORITHM>_InfoType structure. In these functions, the Dem_Debounce<ALGORITHM_SPECIFIC>_InfoType
                  structure is completely initialized.

                  structure, the Dem_DebounceBase_InfoInitDefault function is invoked with a valid pointer to this
                  Dem_DebounceBase_InfoType structure. The Dem_DebounceBase_InfoInitDefault function initializes all
                  elements of the Dem_DebounceBase_InfoType structure.
                  The pointer to the initialized Dem_DebounceBase_InfoType structure which implicitly also points to the
                  Dem_Debounce<DEBOUNCING_ALGORITHM>_InfoType structure is therefore always valid and hence can be passed

                  The buffer pointer provided to the DestinationBuffer is given by the starting address of the entry data array of the specified time
                  series memory plus a calculated offset. It is verified that the range given by this pointer and the buffer size falls completely within
                  the entry data array. The buffer size is Dem_Cfg_GetMaxSnapShotSizeOfTimeSeriesEntryTable(). The time series entry index is ensured to be
                  in the range [0..Dem_Cfg_GetSizeOfTimeSeriesEntryTable()[.

                  The buffer pointer can be received
                  - via a *Dcm API. It is the responsibility of the Dcm
                    to pass a valid destination buffer and matching size.
                  - from an application API with size information. It is the responsibility of the application to pass a valid
                    destination buffer and matching size.
                  - from internal function Dem_MemoryEntry_EventEntry_GetExtendedRecordDataPtr(). This function will always return a valid pointer.
                    In this case the corresponding size is queried with function Dem_Cfg_GlobalERecMaxRawSize().
                  - as argument with corresponding size in an internal function. The internal function passes the pointer to destination buffer
                    and size without modifying to function Dem_Data_InitDestinationBuffer. The caller of the internal function ensures that pointer
                    and size of buffer are valid.
                  - as a pointer corresponding to a local array defined within the function. In this case, it is ensured by reviews that size
                    of the array is equal to the size passed to Dem_Data_InitDestinationBuffer.
